### Introduction

The Patient Profile Monitoring System (PPMS) puts in a mechanism to automate the whole process of prescription issuing to report handling, strictly online, with ZERO usage of papers. We will take full advantage of modern technologies and help save the environment. PPMS will be designed keeping all sorts of use cases and target users in mind, so that the technology is sustainable and susceptible to future updates and changes. There will be separate portals for Doctors and Patients so that privacy and confidentiality is kept and all the reports are indexed properly.
